//! All data structures in this library are generic over the hash type used, defaulting to
//! [BitcoinNodeHash](crate::accumulator::node_hash::BitcoinNodeHash), the one used by Bitcoin
//! as defined by the utreexo spec. However, if you need to use a different hash type, you can
//! implement the [NodeHash](crate::accumulator::node_hash::NodeHash) trait for it, and use it
//! with the accumulator data structures.
//!
//! This example shows how to use a custom hash type based on the Poseidon hash function. The
//! [Poseidon Hash](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf) is a hash function that is optmized
//! for zero-knowledge proofs, and is used in projects like ZCash and StarkNet.
//! If you want to work with utreexo proofs in zero-knowledge you may want to use this instead
//! of our usual sha512-256 that we use by default, since that will give you smaller circuits.
//! This example shows how to use both the [MemForest](crate::accumulator::MemForest::MemForest) and
//! proofs with a custom hash type. The code here should be pretty much all you need to do to
//! use your custom hashes, just tweak the implementation of
//! [NodeHash](crate::accumulator::node_hash::NodeHash) for your hash type.
